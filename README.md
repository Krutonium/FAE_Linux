## Contribution Guidelines

- **Major cosmetic changes** will not be accepted and will be **rejected**.
- Small, meaningful changes such as **pattern updates** or minor functionality improvements are **welcome**.
- Pull requests that introduce **large, sweeping changes** that are difficult to review will be rejected **without comment**, due to **security and maintainability concerns**.

Please ensure your contributions are focused, clear, and easy to review. Thank you for your understanding!

## Notes
You can find the results of tests in the latest release notes.

Get the patterns from ghidra.<br>
I used the windows patterns as a reference, this makes it very easy to find the patterns.<br>
If there is an update you can just compare the old and new file versions, no need to use the windows version. <br>
